on home page, when it gets to "from" make that have a blue background, white text.

maybe just move github / linkedin logos to the contact page? put them under melb, vic thing... justified right?

put the MYOB interview video on the about me page instead of the photo.. center align?

MCJ-V as logo on other pages

contact page add github and linkedin
put phone in blue background
put email in blue 
melb / vic 

add side arrow on home to go to next page.. on every page. I guess this is sorta adding a footer element to each page. On hover, turn the arrow grey. 
home has V >
about has < > 
skills has < >
projects has < >
contact has <
make them bounce 
on projects page make them sticky. + center align projects + add title "projects blog" with blue background white text, aligned to the right side of the page. Add date + tags to posts.

When you're on the page, underline + make blue the icon in the navbar. is this like nav:active ? 

make arrow and linkedin / github bounce every 4 sec repeat?
