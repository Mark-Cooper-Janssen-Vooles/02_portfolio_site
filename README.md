## Sitemap
The user will land on the home page, and be presented with a navbar to go to the other pages. There will also be a footer: on the home page there will be a down link which takes you into a parallax scrolling story, or a right pointing arrow that will take you to the about page (the next one in the navbar). If you choose to scroll through the parallax story, at the bottom there will be an arrow which takes you back to the top of the page. 

On the about page the navbar stays the same, but the "about" link is colored and underlined to signify to the user that they are on that page. In the footer, you can go left (back to home) or right (to skills).

In the skills page, the navbar has the same feature that highlights the current page. The arrows in the footer go left (back to about) or right (to projects).

In the projects page, the navbar has the same feature that highlights the current page. The arrows in the footer go left (back to skills) or right (to contact).

In the contact page, the navbar has the same feature that highlights the current page. The arrows in the footer go left (back to projects).
